Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

Please organize, design, and submit your code as if it were going into production,
then send us a link to a publicly-hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

A "complete solution" means that we should be able to run your submission according to your instructions and is something you would feel comfortable with for a production-grade application.

You may assume that the machine we run your code on will contain standard tooling for your coding language, however we cannot grade a submission we cannot run so please add any details you believe to be relevant for us run your code.


Functional spec
---------------

Prototype the following projects:

### Noteworth Lunch Requirements

1. A user should be able to create a restaurant. (Name, foodtype, address, rating etc.)
2. A user should be able to obtain a list of restaurants.
3. A user should be able to view details of a restaurant based on the restaurant they select from the list.
4. A user should be able to edit and delete a restaurant.
5. A user should be able to submit a rating for a restaurant.
6. A user should be able to sort the list of restaurants by Highest Rating.
7. The view should be fully independent of any data layer(s).
8. The app should be extensible to other entities.

Please spend however much time it takes to construct a solution you are satisfied with. Note that we value *quality* over *feature completeness*. You should expect to spend about 4 hours on this project. We value your time: if you find you have spent significantly longer than recommended please stop, note where you are leaving off, and get in contact with us and we will review the project as-is.

Technical spec
--------------

**iOS** projects should use Swift.

**Android** projects should use Java.

**Backend** projects should use Python/Django.

**Frontend** projects should use React/Redux.

For Web developer submissions, a backend-focused submission may have a basic frontend but should be comprehensive enough so that we can validate the user experience in the browser. A Frontend-focused submission can use static data but should showcase your ability to create a modern, attractive UI and comprehensive enough so that it can "plug in" to an API.

All solutions should follow up-to-date technical standards of the core implementation language.

How will we review?

High Level UI/UX Inspiration
-----------------------------
You can use the [Yelp website](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=restaurants&find_loc=285+Fulton+St%2C+New+York%2C+NY+10006) to get inspiration on how to present the List, Sorting, and Details page. We do not want you to re-implement Yelp, but
you may use the screenshots in `images` to get started. Add your own flavor and make it your own, we want to know who _you_ are! The screenshots presented here are just for inspiration, they are not requirements.
