Coding challenge
==================================

At Noteworth we believe the best indicator of success is in an engineer's ability to write clear, consise, and effective code; not their capability to invert a binary tree on the fly or design a social network using carrier pidgeons. With that in mind we have designed a challenge that is relavant to the work we do. The assessment details are described in [coding challenge](coding_challenge.md) and is designed to take about 4 hours, to be completed on your time and when you are able, using any and all resources at your disposal as if it were a real work environment. 


Readme
------

All submissions MUST contain a README.

Write your README as if it was for a production service with a team of collaborators. Include the following items:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end, or full stack.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural. 
* Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to the hosted application if applicable.
* Link to your resume or public profile.
* Links to other code you're particularly proud of.

How we review
-------------

Your application will be reviewed by at least three of our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level and the time put into the assessment.

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

* **Architecture**: Fault-tolerance, backward compatibility, extensibility, reliability, maintainability, availability, security, usability, and other such â€“ilities
* **Clarity**: Does the README clearly and concisely explain both the problem and solution? Are technical tradeoffs explained? Does it accurately reflect the state of the application?
* **Correctness**: Does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code quality**: Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it internally consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Security**: Are there any obvious vulnerabilities?
* **Testing**: How thorough is the test suite? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change? Are there some unit and some integration tests?
	* We're not looking for 100% code coverage, just enough to get a feel for your thoughtfulness and approach.
* **UX**: Is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the API intuitive?
* **Technical choices**: Do the choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the implementation?

Bonus point (these items are optional):

* **Scalability**: Will technical choices scale well? If not, is there a discussion of those choices in the README? 
* **Production-readiness**: Does the code include error handling, logging, debugging/secrets, etc?

If you are unable to conplete this assessment, you may alternatively submit a work sample of existing code. If you submit a work sample it should be something you are especially proud of and that you believe represents you (or who you'd like to be!) as an engineer.

Existing code
-------------

If you have existing code that you'd like us to look at, please follow the following guidelines:

* Include a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...). We cannot review archives or single files.
* The repo should include a README that follows the [principles described below](#readme) In particular, please make sure to include high-level explanation about what the code is doing.
* Ideally, the code you're providing:
  * Has been written by you alone. If not, please tell us which part you wrote and are most proud of in the README.
  * Is leveraging web technologies.
  * Is deployed and hosted somewhere.
* The sample should be short, no longer than 1000 lines of code.
  * If the code sample is part of a larger project, please identify what specifically you would like us to review.
  * Your sample must include tests and should contain instructions on how to run them.
  * More code is not necessarily better!
